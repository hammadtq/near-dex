# near-dex
 
Simply run `npm start` after cloning the project.

**Project:** Near DEX

**Motivation:** Rust contracts making cross-contract calls

**Details:** 3 contracts were mainly deployed. One was of Fun token, another similar called ETHB and then I wrote my own contract in rust for an exchange. The contract has a orderbook, it allows the user to submit funds to the contract and then keeps a map of the orders. If an order matches another, it simply executes it.

The video features the exchange contract getting executed on the terminal and then it moves on to the front-end for the exchange.

**Future Plans:** At the moment, its single player, need to make it multi-player and enhance it to a full-fledge dex.
